_Exiled
===

_Exiled is a WordPress theme focused around the new WordPress Gutenberg editor. It it meant to be minimal, and not very customizable. Sorry about that.

This theme is built with a very specific website in mind, and is not really meant to be used like a typical drop-in WordPress theme. It is based on the _s theme, and like _s, is meant for everyone to hack at it, and remix and edit it however you want.
